## Installation

### 1. **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Termux (or any Linux-like environment)
- `curl`, `jq`, `glow`  

Install them using:
```bash
pkg install curl jq glow
```

Additionally, you will need a Google Gemini API key.

### 2. **Get Your Gemini API Key**
- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key.  
- Save this key in a file named `.gemini_key` in your Termux home directory:
```bash
echo "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > ~/.gemini_key
```
> Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

### 3. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdulqoreeb/gemini-cli.git
cd gemini-cli
```

### 4. **Make Scripts Executable**
```bash
chmod +x gemini generate_chat_name.sh install_requirements.sh
```

### 5. **Install Dependencies**
Run the following script to install required packages:
```bash
./install_requirements.sh
```
This installs `curl`, `jq`, and optionally `glow` for Markdown rendering.

### 6. **Add to Your PATH** (Optional but Recommended)
To run `gemini` commands from any directory, add the `gemini-cli` directory to your shell's PATH:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```
Add the following line at the bottom:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/gemini-cli:$PATH"
```
Apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```
